A collection of useful scripts for UNIX-based operating systems.

Current Scripts:

listdrives - Lists all drives and partitions that are currently available.

listdrivestofile - Lists all drives and partitions that are currently available, then sends said list to a new file.

listtofile - Creates a text file, in the current directory, with a list of everything in the current directory (minus the list, itself).

tarcreate - Creates a tar archive. You must supply the actual directory that you want to be included, followed by the filename for the new archive.

tarcreate - Creates a tar archive (just like "tarcreate"), using GZip2.

testnetworkcon - Tests your network connection. This test will continue to run until you kill it, using CTRL+C.
