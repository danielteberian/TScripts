A collection of useful scripts for UNIX-based operating systems.

Current Scripts:

listtofile - Creates a text file, in the current directory, with a list of everything in the current directory (minus the list, itself).

tarcreate - Creates a tar archive. You must supply the actual directory that you want to be included, followed by the filename for the new archive.

tarcreate - Creates a tar archive (just like "tarcreate"), using GZip2.
